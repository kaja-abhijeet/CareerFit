<h1>Career Recommendation Platform using Machine Learning</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This platform leverages machine learning to help students make informed career choices by analyzing their academic performance. Based on the marks provided by the user, the system predicts suitable career options using a trained model, aligning career paths with the user's strengths and academic interests.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Mark-based Career Predictions:</strong> Students input their marks, and the system generates career path predictions based on a machine learning model.</li>
  <li><strong>Machine Learning Model:</strong> The platform uses a trained model to evaluate marks across various subjects and predicts suitable career paths.</li>
  <li><strong>User-Friendly Interface:</strong> A simple, intuitive interface that allows students to submit their marks and get career recommendations.</li>
  <li><strong>Diverse Career Options:</strong> The platform suggests a wide variety of career options across fields like engineering, medicine, arts, commerce, and more, based on model predictions.</li>
  <li><strong>Model Training:</strong> The system is trained on a dataset of academic performance and career choices, ensuring accurate recommendations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How It Works</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Input Marks:</strong> The user inputs their academic marks for relevant subjects.</li>
  <li><strong>Career Prediction:</strong> The machine learning model evaluates the input and predicts the most relevant career paths.</li>
  <li><strong>Recommendation List:</strong> A list of career predictions is displayed, ranked by relevance to the user's academic performance.</li>
  <li><strong>Detailed Career Info:</strong> Users can explore career details like qualifications, prospects, and growth opportunities.</li>
